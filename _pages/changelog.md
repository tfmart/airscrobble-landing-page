## Add new discoveries to Liked Tracks on Last.fm

## Start matching or check your history with Quick Actions

Need to discover what's playing around ASAP? Or want to remember what was that song that you got hooked on earlier in the day? With the newly added Quick Actions you can press and hold the app's icon to access new shortcuts to access a feature as soon as the app opens! For this inital release, we are launching Quick Actions to start matching when opening the app and to access your history.

And for the powerusers out there, we are also exposing these shortcuts through a new URL scheme that's been added with version 1.1! AirScrobble will use the `airscrobble://` format and you can launch these quick actions with the following URLs:

- `airscrobble://match` to start matching upon opening the app
- `airscrobble://history` to open the history page in the app
