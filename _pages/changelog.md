I'm glad to announce that AirScrobble is finally available in the App Store! After months of working on my spare time, it's great to finally put out this tool that has been quite helpful for me and I hope you find it useful as well!

I've shared the story behind the app on Product Hunt if you want to learn more about how this app came to be. Make sure you give it a look and show some support:
