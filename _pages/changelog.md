### `Initial Release`
# **Version 1.0 (TestFlight build)**
AirScrobble is currently under beta on TestFlight. On this inital release I am aiming to release the core feature of this app, which is beign able to identify a song playing around and to scrobble it on a Last.fm profile quickly. If you're interested in joining the TestFlight, feel free to [send us a message on our Twitter profile](twitter.com/airscrobble)!
